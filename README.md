This is a project to pull together all of the statistics for monsters in the Monster Legends mobile/Facebook game in an easy-to-read format for viewing on a mobile device.

It wouldn't have been possible without contributions from these people:
* nmtan, creator of [the monster-wiki.com site](http://www.monster-wiki.com), from which all of the statistics are drawn.
* [Cloroxspill](http://forums.socialpointgames.com/member.php?269628-cloroxspill) on the [Monster Legends forums](http://forums.socialpointgames.com/forumdisplay.php?130-Monster-Legends), 
who did the real legwork of compiling monster statistics from the wiki site into a spreadsheet.
